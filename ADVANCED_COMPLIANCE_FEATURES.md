# üöÄ Advanced Compliance Features - EASA FTL Checker

## Overview

The EASA FTL Checker now includes comprehensive **Advanced Compliance Features** that provide enhanced monitoring and analysis of flight crew duty periods according to EASA regulations. These features go beyond basic daily compliance to track cumulative limits, assess fatigue risk, and provide proactive safety recommendations.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. **Cumulative Flight Time Tracking** 
*Regulation: ORO.FTL.210(a)*

- **Weekly Flight Time**: Tracks flight time over 7 consecutive days (limit: 60 hours)
- **Monthly Flight Time**: Tracks flight time per calendar month (limit: 190 hours)  
- **Yearly Flight Time**: Tracks flight time per calendar year (limit: 1000 hours)

**Benefits:**
- Prevents regulatory violations before they occur
- Provides early warning when approaching limits
- Ensures compliance with EASA cumulative flight time requirements

### 2. **Cumulative Duty Time Tracking**
*Regulation: ORO.FTL.190*

- **Weekly Duty Time**: Tracks total duty time over 7 consecutive days (limit: 60 hours)
- **Fortnightly Duty Time**: Tracks total duty time over 14 consecutive days (limit: 110 hours)

**Benefits:**
- Monitors overall workload beyond just flight time
- Includes all duty types (flight, standby, training, admin)
- Prevents excessive duty accumulation

### 3. **Enhanced Fatigue Risk Assessment**
*Regulation: ORO.FTL.120*

**Fatigue Scoring System (0-5 scale):**
- **0-1**: Low risk (green)
- **2**: Medium risk (yellow) 
- **3+**: High risk (red)

**Risk Factors Assessed:**
- **High Sector Count**: 6+ flight sectors in a duty period (+2 points)
- **Night Duty**: Duties starting 22:00-06:00 (+1 point)
- **Early Start**: Duties starting before 06:00 (+1 point)
- **Late Finish**: Duties ending after 02:00 (+1 point)

**Benefits:**
- Proactive fatigue risk identification
- Evidence-based scoring system
- Specific recommendations for risk mitigation

### 4. **Consecutive Duty Monitoring**
*Regulation: ORO.FTL.190*

- Tracks consecutive duty days across all duty types
- Alerts when exceeding 4 consecutive duty days
- Recommends adequate rest periods

**Benefits:**
- Prevents fatigue accumulation from extended work periods
- Ensures adequate recovery time
- Supports crew scheduling decisions

### 5. **Specialized Risk Detection**

#### Night Duty Fatigue Risk
- Automatically detects duties during circadian low periods
- Provides specific recommendations for night operations
- Considers disruption to natural sleep patterns

#### High Sector Count Risk  
- Identifies duties with 6+ flight sectors
- Recognizes increased workload and fatigue potential
- Recommends enhanced monitoring

### 6. **Multi-Language Support**
All advanced features support three languages:
- **English** (EN) - Primary language
- **Russian** (RU) - Complete translations
- **Latvian** (LV) - Complete translations

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Enhancements (`utils/easaChecker.js`)

**New Functions Added:**
- `addAdvancedComplianceChecks()` - Main orchestration function
- `addCumulativeFlightTimeChecks()` - Weekly/monthly/yearly flight time tracking
- `addCumulativeDutyTimeChecks()` - Weekly/fortnightly duty time tracking  
- `addFatigueRiskAssessment()` - Comprehensive fatigue scoring

**New EASA Limits:**
```javascript
maxDutyTime: {
  weekly: 60,        // hours per 7 consecutive days
  fortnightly: 110,  // hours per 14 consecutive days
},

fatigueRisk: {
  highSectorCount: 6,         // 6+ sectors = high risk
  nightDutyStart: 22,         // Night duty starts 22:00
  nightDutyEnd: 6,            // Night duty ends 06:00
  earlyStart: 6,              // Early start before 06:00
  lateFinish: 2,              // Late finish after 02:00
  maxConsecutiveDuties: 4,    // Max consecutive duty days
}
```

### Frontend Enhancements (`client/src/`)

**Updated Components:**
- `ResultsPage.tsx` - Added 5 new columns for advanced compliance data
- `FlightDataContext.tsx` - Extended TypeScript interfaces
- All language files updated with new translations

**New Display Columns:**
- **Weekly FT** - Weekly flight time with limit checking
- **Monthly FT** - Monthly flight time with limit checking  
- **Weekly DT** - Weekly duty time with limit checking
- **Fatigue Risk** - Color-coded fatigue score chip (0-5)
- **Consecutive** - Consecutive duty day count
